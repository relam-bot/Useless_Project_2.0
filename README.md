# [Late Comer Excuse Generator] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Relam]


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Joseph Mathew] - [College of Engineering Munnar]

### Project Description
we made a execuse generator that generate execuses based on time,whether,location,news and role(student,work,friend).

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Having to think of execuses whenever your late

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Having a generated execuse ready to go based on current world affairs.

## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
Python
Api for gemini,news,whether etc
HTML
Json
Ai Python Integration

# Run
To run the Code you have to setup your FastAPI server normally on your local machine and run the index.html.You will also need the API keys as i cant publish mine openenly.This code works just need the right environment but as i couldnt host it in github due to this API issue .i hope it doesnt leave a negative review. 

### Project Demo
# Video
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1GffCpMswn3en11DfQx6dYpTijizJ1owZ?usp=sharing
The above video demonstrates the working model.The Full code couldnt be published because it contains API keys which cant be shared.The demo shows how the execuse will be generated based on ur ip.The code will learn ur location,recent news ,whether and time and generate execuse based on but as it couldnt be hosted the ip i showed in demo is the default ip addresss.some images may show i couldnt find execuse which is due to reaching the daily limit of the APIs.I hope u understand how hard it was to build it using completely zero cost.
